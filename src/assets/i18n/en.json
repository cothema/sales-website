At the same time, we already have other waiting clients in reserve with an interest in your product (usually 10 - 20), to whom you can offer your services as soon as they are verified on a small sample. We will dose other clients to you as you will be able to scale your business."

In general, this type of marketing is more suitable for B2C services that have low commissions per customer. We can offer ways to combine marketing and business appropriately and connect you with a marketing agency that will take care of you, or provide you with general recommendations."
